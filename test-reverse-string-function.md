# Introduction

We're on a mission to add tests to our JavaScript codebase. You are tasked with
writing Jasmine tests for the provided code.


## Getting Started

Open up the terminal and use the following instructions to get started.

```no-highlight
$ cd ~/challenges       # for Mac/Linux
$ cd %HOME%/challenges  # for Windows
$ et get test-reverse-string-function
```

Open the `test-reverse-string-function` project folder in your editor.

Open the `test-reverse-string-function/specRunner.html` file in your browser.


## Problem Statement

The code in `reverseString.js` has no tests. We cannot be certain that it is
working reliably.

Using your knowledge of JavaScript testing, write unit tests for the
`reverseString()` function in the `reverseStringSpec.js` file. Provide an
appropriate number and variety of test cases to ensure the function works as
expected. Correct the `reverseString()` function, if necessary.

Reloading the page in the browser will re-run the test suite.


## Submitting Your Code

Once you have completed this exercise, use the `et` command to submit your code
from this project's folder.

```no-highlight
$ cd ~/challenges/test-reverse-string-function       # for Mac/Linux
$ cd %HOME%/challenges/test-reverse-string-function  # for Windows
$ et submit
```
